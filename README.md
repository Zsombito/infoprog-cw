THE PLAN:

**Paul's questions:**

What are we doing whats the game?

What is Zsombor doing?

What is each person going to do?


Paul's point of view:

We should do a game before implementing multiplayer (we should have a working game first). Paul also sais that Zsombor should take lead on multiplayer and that we have to help Zsombor with the game because no matter how amazing Zsombor is he can't do this alone.



Bardia's point of view:


We can do levels. The fiste version is the player has to walk to the middle. When you walk to a certain coordinate you win the level. Could start really easy like a line. Then goes harder.


Paul says:

We have to figure out collisions, characters, players. We have to ste a date and time to meet in person so meeting can be more fruitful. For next time we have to start learning C sharp and come prepared. We need a more specific goal it is too broad. Zsdombor will have fixed the bug by then and we distrute the roles. WE should meet during the weekend (saturday).


Paul didn't know Floro is working on the game itself. LACK OF COMMUNICATION! (genuinely) Nt good enough for a group project.


Zsombor says:

We cannot help him untill he figures it out. He is stuck and needs to fix it so that we can maybe help him.WE mostly have never seen what Zsombor has been working on maybe he heas to teach us before we can help him but is this helpfull?

It is now a asynchronus TCP server and thats what Zsombor is working on at the moment.

Learn about C sharp events and watch tutorials.


Conclusion:
Rhea is now manager.
